	  </p><h3>An interactive tool for prediction, visualization and selection of missing segments in proteins</h3>
	  
           SuperLooper2 is an interactive web service for the insertion
	   of missing segments such as loops in proteins. Loop candidates
	   are selected from a pre-calculated database containing ~700 million
	   protein fragments with a residue length of 3-35. The fragments are
	   extracted from structural coordinates deposited in the RSCB PDB <a target="_self" href="references.php">[4]</a>.
	   
           <h3>Visualization</h3>
           Integration of the NGL viewer <a target="_self" href="references.php">[7]</a>, a molecular viewer based on WebGL,
	   allows visualization and interactive selection of a loop from a
	   list of 50 suitable candidates. A color code is provided to
	   indicate clashes or  other relevant criteria to promote an
	   individual choice of the most suitable loop.
	   
           <h3>Results</h3>
           A selected loop can be downloaded inserted into
	   the user provided protein. In addition, all 50 loop candidates can be downloaded
	   for further analyses.
