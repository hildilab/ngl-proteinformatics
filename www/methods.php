        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <h2>Database</h2>
        <p>To construct the database all overlapping fragments with a
        length of 3 to 35 were extracted from a collection of about
        100.000 protein structures currently deposited in the PDB.
        For each fragment the following informations are stored in the
        database: Sequence, PDB identifier, location in the protein
        and a geometrical fingerprint that characterizes each fragment.
        The total number of fragments sum up to over 700 million.
		The number of available fragments is decreasing with increasing
        number of residues. This is caused by the fact that a smaller
        number of long fragments can be extracted from a structure, i.e.
        for the fragment length of 3 amino acids 23 million fragments
        are available, while for a fragment length of 35 this number declines
        to approximately 18 million.</p>

        <h2>Geometric fingerprint</h2>
        <p> The geometrical fingerprint matching is used to evaluate
		 the sterical fit of the stem atoms of the N- and C-termini of each database fragment
		 to the C- and N-terminal stem atoms of a gap in a protein structure. 
		The geometrical fingerprints of both, the termini of each Superlooper2
        fragment and the N- and C-terminal stem atoms of a requested segment,
        is composed by the distance between their N- and C-terminal stem atoms and
        three angles defining the relative orientation of the stem atoms (Fig. 2). This fingerprint
        is a slight alteration of the fingerprint used in our older publication.
        The previous combination of two distances and two angles was adjusted by the usage of one distance
        and three angles. Analysis of the previous fingerprint revealed that the
        score was slightly biased towards that residue where the angle was measured.
        By using angles on both stem residues, the resulting score does not privilege
        the fit of the candidate fragment to one stem residue over the other any more.</p>

         <p><i><b>Fig 2: Schematic representation of the geometrical fingerprint:</b>
         The geometrical fingerprint is characterized by the distance d between
         the N-terminal C atom and the C-terminal N atom and the following three angles:
         &alpha; defined by the line between C&alpha;<sup>(N)</sup>  and C<sup>(N)</sup>
         and d, &beta; is spanned by the line between N<sup>(C)</sup>  and C&alpha;<sup>(C)</sup>
         and d,  &gamma;: the angle between the two planes A (defined by C&alpha;<sup>(N)</sup>,
         C<sup>(N)</sup>) and N<sup>(C)</sup>) and B (C&alpha;<sup>(C)</sup>, C<sup>(N)</sup>
         and N<sup>(C)</sup>).</i></p>   
        <h2>Fragment Search</h2>
        <p>For the fragment search a stepwise approach is used
        to minimize the search time as far as possible. In a
        first step all fragments with the required sequence
        length that fit to the stem atoms with an accuracy of
        at least 0.75 &Aring; RMSD are selected. For the second step the 500 best
        fitting candidates are chosen based on a quick estimation
        of the steric fit of the fragment to the rest of the protein.
        Subsequently, these 500 fragment are ranked by a score that
        takes account of sequence similarity between the fragment and the
        target sequence as well as the fit of the geometrical fingerprint
        of the fragment to the stem atoms. To guarantee that the results describe
        the most suitable conformational space, fragments with an
        identical sequence or a backbone RMSD smaller than 1 &Aring; are removed
        from the resulting list.</p>
