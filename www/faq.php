       <h4> Is a registration needed?</h4>

No, SuperLooper2 is free for all users and no login is required.

<h4>For what purpose can it be used?</h4>

SuperLooper2 can be used to search protein segments of a length from 3 to 35 reidues from a database of known structures. and place them in a existing protein structure.

<h4> What information is needed to search for a protein fragment?</h4>

The user has to specify two stem residues that represent the endpoints of the fragment and the sequence of the queried segment.

<h4>What sequence will the found fragment have?</h4>

The primary sequence of the found fragment will be automatically mutated to the sequence that the user has provided in the search criteria.
<h4>Are the sidechains included?</h4>
The sidechains of the found fragment are not included. We recommend to add the sidechains, using a standard tool to add the sidechains and to perform energy minimization afterwards.

<h4>Do I have to install a plugin to use the NGL viewer?</h4>
No, the NGL viewer based solely on browser technologies that are provided by every modern web-browser. Additional installations are not needed.
